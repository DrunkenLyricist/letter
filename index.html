"How do I burn the letters that are soaked in your fragrance?
How do I burn the letters immersed in love?
How do I burn the letters written by your hands?

You wrote, avoiding the gaze of the world,
Year after year, writing my name repeatedly.
Sometimes during the day, sometimes getting up at night to write.
In the letters soaked in your fragrance.

Those words that I remembered like water,
Those messages that were dear to me like a symbol,
Those precious signs that were like treasures.
How do I burn the letters that are soaked in your fragrance?
How do I burn the letters immersed in love?
How do I burn the letters written by your hands?
Today, I'll immerse your letters in the Ganges
I have come to immerse them in the flowing water, ablaze."


Dear friend,
I hope you're doing well, haha, the sadist doesn't care about that, the sadist just wants sheer disappointment and anger to be seen in one's eyes. 
Here is a complete guideline on how to create your own, very personal sadist friend that doesn't respect your boundaries:

Prequistes:
The sadist, COMPLETELY enjoys the absence of a friend in his life, afterall that's all what a sadist wants. 
A sadist may have psychological issues about confrontation, but it can be completely ignored and the person can continue. The sadist always rejoices duality in his nature and communication.

Step-1:	Make sure the sadist is well identified. Any mistake in determination of a sadist can cause a huge energy drain and waste of time.

Step 2:	A sadist, may sometimes make mistakes, but it is completely okay to forgive, the sadist, however, the sadist has to blamed completely in case whatsoever.

Step 3:	You may, sometimes, identify the sadist wrongly, and sometimes you might experience duality with sadist, as everything hitherto, be very careful in identifying this as intentional, do not, in case try to relate it with the fact that the sadist may not have being a sadist.

Step 4:	After the sadist, is done with you, or you are done with the sadist, be sure to discard the sadist and its associates in every way possible. A new genre of people has to be searched for next.


"Why did you sway away?
Aches echoed inside, resonated with the Play.
Oh you're cached everywhere.
When your tear took a slide,
-it too drenched me inside.
Peeped at you, the drizzle mizzled,
-drops still dripped, for I heard the fizzle.
You were weeping,
I was still leering.

She never went awry,
I had followed her trail,
Never did she ever gaze at me,
But I knew she was confiding to me.
She is a reflection, 
a reflection in the pond
But I was a silly man,
with a pebble in my hand."

I may have identified you wrongly, and you may have it too. This is absolutely human, and no one needs to apologise for this. It is really hard for me to forget the presence you had in my life for the 15 months we texted. I absolutely joyous lived those moments. I don't need to prove that I'm not a silicone, because I am a one. I had psychological issues where to continue the jokes I had to be like that. A true transcendental joke. The nine months of silence told me everything that what I did wrong, or what were the problems in me; I have, fully amended myself, I have, done the necessary conditions so that I can remove my dual behaviour. It is a thing of the past. I have absolutely no reason to live in my past. But I have been haunted by it presently. And I wish to clear the things up.

"Oh you dear El,
you have made me zestless piece of shit.
I spent years trying to prate,
your mixed expression, leaned me to fate
Your Aphrodisian beauty is what for I glimped,
I should better heed to Avogadro's constant.
Neither Medi., nor off jacked,
A quirk of you, and my cephal is soothed.
Please go away or just give a clue,
I can't live in blue,
I can't live in blues.

Alas! It was good whilst it lasted,
was it just a mirage, that I enlarged?
Short was the Tryst,
-showed me my needs and
no one gives a shit of other's deeds.
What a complex machine Sapien is,
impedes from the past memoirs,
shatters its own memoirs,
shatters its own memoirs.

What do I do?
I'm out of band-aids,
It's like walking on rakes.
The gist is it to forget,
walk away from the wine,
sour is the grape,
sour are the grapes."

I should've tried to communicate with you within two weeks of the doomsday. I am wrong, and I bear that burden to this date. I wrote to you. But the meek me, always overpowered me and never actually allowed me to say anything freely without my own imposed restrictions on the maintainance of my personality. I sincerely apologise, for it, if it wasn't me, then why the FUCK would I expend this energy in writing this shit ;) I spew angst and cold hatred for me, but I expend energy, I care, even though, it might seem it is fa√ßade. 


a time to be born, and a time to die;
a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;
a time to kill, and a time to heal;
a time to break down, and a time to build up;
a time to weep, and a time to laugh;
a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together;
a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
a time to seek, and a time to lose;
a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
a time to tear, and a time to sew;
a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
a time to love, and a time to hate;
a time for war, and a time for peace.



I still remember her; of the lovely talks we had, be rather cringe. Of her enquiry of my crush, of my pretence to make a riddle. Of her guessing the L, of her beautiful long midnight texts. Of her jokes and sarcasm, her memories, the bismuth triads. Of our long-drawn fights and vows of silence. Of her late night revelations, of her early morning thoughts. Of her brief images, of her voice-notes. Of her reaction to my memes. Of her smile, of her lips, her brows and cheeks. Of her recurring calls, and messages. Of our fights and my ineptness  to tell her I love her. Of my poems, and her reactions and her "chalaa jayega". Of the video edits, of the birthday sagas. Of our trysts beside the dustbin, on cycles, long and timid journeys. Of despising children and rejoicing Rick and Morty. Of the sync of the songs and her BOLLYWOOD. Of Kala Kendra and the Ragas. Of the Bhimplasi, Taals, harmoniums, and the old's urination. Of the water spillage, Munchkins and the slaps. Of the curses and the laughs. Of the drawings and selfish giants. Of the sideman. Of the blockage, the toodles, the goodbyes and the funnies and byes.

Deep down, I want a nice friend to return, not Kashvi. Kashvi's return is beyond my control. For I have given her pain. She is probably happy, I don't have the slightest idea of what she is upto. I can't care less. She would return, possibly in different clothing. This isn't an apology letter, neither a love one. This is simply a PLAY stating everything I had ever felt from 15.04.2021 to 13.08.2022.


Let's become strangers again, just once more
I won't expect any kindness from you,
Don't look at me with misjudgment in your eyes,
Don't let my words make your heart falter,
Don't let the secrets of your struggle show in your gaze.

There are things that also restrain you from going forward.
People say that these displays are just an illusion,
And my past is stained with indignities,
Your shadow also bears the nights that have passed.

If recognition becomes a disease, it is better to forget it,
If respect becomes a burden, it is better to break it,
The story which cannot reach its conclusion,
It is better to leave it with a beautiful turn.
Let's become strangers again, just once more.


In the end, I would like quote a famous statesman, and a model's words: "‡§Ü‡§® ‡§¨‡§æ‡§® ‡§∂‡§æ‡§®, ‡§´‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ç‡§∏‡•á‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•ã ‡§≤‡§æ‡§ö‡•ã‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§≠‡§æ‡§à ‡§≤‡•á‡§≤‡•ã ‡§π‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ó‡§æ‡§Ç‡§°! ‡§ú‡§æ ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§µ‡§æ‡§á‡§¨ ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ö ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§π‡•ã ‡§∞‡§π‡•Ä!!! üôÇ".

Toodles,
None other than,
Ladesh.
